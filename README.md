# Neural Network Charity Analysis
---

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a neural netowrk learning model that determines if organizations will be successful if they receive funding from the Alphabet Soup charity. By creating a model that can accurately predict success rates, the charity can be optimized to ensure they are funding the right organizations.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
##### What variables are considered targets for the model?

##### What variables are considered features for the model?

##### What variables are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the data?


### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
##### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions were selected for the neural network model, and why?

##### Was the target model performance achieved?

##### What steps were taken to try to increase model performance?
